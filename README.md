# FitnessTracker

# The fitness tracker web app lets users log their runs by route, distance, and date.

This fitness tracker is a full-stack web application with Java 21 and Spring Boot, using Thymeleaf for templated views and Bootstrap for styling. It supports basic CRUD operations, such as adding and deleting workout records, and stores data in an H2 in-memory database. The project follows a clean MVC structure and is managed with Maven for easy build and dependency handling.
